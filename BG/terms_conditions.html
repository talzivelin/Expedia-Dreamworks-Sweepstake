	<h3>EXPEDIA APP TRIP-A-DAY SWEEPSTAKES OFFICIAL RULES</h3>
    <h3>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY. A PURCHASE WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING.</h3>
    <ol>
    	<li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> The Sweepstakes is open only to legal residents of the fifty (50) United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, who are at least eighteen (18) years old (“Entrant”). Employees of Expedia, Inc. and CMD (“Administrator”), and each of their respective parent companies, owners, subsidiaries, affiliates, retailers, distributors, officers, directors, employees, contractors, governors, related entities, partners, partnerships, principals, agents, attorneys, insurers, licensees, sponsors, representatives, shareholders, successors and assigns, and advertising/promotion agencies (collectively, “Released Parties”), as well as the immediate family (spouse, parents, siblings, and children) and/or household members of those employees, are not eligible. </li>
        <li><strong>Sponsor:</strong> The Sweepstakes is sponsored by Expedia, Inc. ("Sponsor"). </li>
        <li><strong>Entry Period:</strong> The Sweepstakes begins at 12:00:01 AM PST on August 5, 2013 and ends at 11:59:59 PM PST on October 13, 2013 (the "Entry Period"). The Entry Period will be divided into seventy (70) days, each of which begins at 12:00:01 AM PST and ends at 11:59:59 PM PST. Entries submitted before or after the Entry Period will not be eligible. Sponsor's computer is the official time-keeping device for the Sweepstakes. </li>
        <li><strong>How to Enter:</strong> There are two (2) ways to enter using your Android or iOS smart phone. (1) Current Expedia App users must download the current available version from this site: expedia.com/tripaday, and log in to their account. Once you have downloaded the latest version of the Expedia App and have signed in to your account during the Entry Period, you will automatically receive one (1) entry into the drawing associated with that day. (2) New Expedia App users must download the current available version from this site: expedia.com/tripaday, and sign in and create a new account. Once you have downloaded the latest version of the Expedia App and have signed in and created a new account during the Entry Period, you will automatically receive one (1) entry into the drawing associated with that day. You may not use multiple email addresses to enter. Users who uninstall and re-install are not eligible for entry on multiple days. Entries will not be acknowledged. By entering the Sweepstakes, you indicate your full and unconditional agreement to, and acceptance of, (a) these Official Rules and (b) Sponsor's decisions, which are final and binding. </li>
        <li><strong>Drawing:</strong> Sponsor will select one (1) potential winner per day in a random drawing of all entries received associated with that day during the Entry Period. The odds of being selected depend on the number of entries received for the applicable drawing. Entries that are not selected in one drawing will not be carried forward to subsequent drawings. Sponsor will attempt to notify potential winners via an email message from <a href="mailto:ExpediaTripADayGiveaway@cmdagency.com">ExpediaTripADayGiveaway@cmdagency.com</a> within ten (10) business days of selection. An individual can establish only one (1) account and win only one (1) prize during the Entry Period. </li>
        <li><strong>Notification and Requirements of Potential Winners:</strong> Winners must redeem the Coupon prize toward hotel and packages by March 31, 2014 and must use either a personal computer for hotel and packages, or the Mobile App for hotel-only redemption. Except where prohibited by law, each winner may be required to complete and return an affidavit of eligibility and liability/publicity release. If a winner fails to sign and return these documents within five (5) working days, an alternate winner may be selected in his/her place in a random drawing of all remaining entries received. Only three (3) alternate winners may be contacted. If a winner cannot be validated for a daily drawing the prize will not be awarded.</li>
        <li><strong>Prizes:</strong> Seventy (70) winners will receive a one-time use travel Coupon with a price cap of $1,200.00 USD. The Coupon must be used in its entirety. If a winner&rsquo;s itinerary exceeds the price cap, the winner will receive a credit equal to the $1,200.00 USD price cap. The prize will be fulfilled by Expedia, Inc. Winners are responsible for paying any applicable income taxes and any and all other costs and expenses associated with the purchase. Any prize details not specified in these Official Rules will be determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion. A prize may not be transferred and must be accepted as awarded. No transfer, assignment, cash alternative or substitution of prizes (or applicable portion thereof) will be allowed, except Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to substitute prizes of comparable value if any prize listed is unavailable, in whole or in part, for any reason. The Total Approximate Retail Value (ARV) of each daily drawing is $1,200.00 USD.</li>
        <li><strong>General Conditions:</strong> In the event that the operation, security, or administration of the Sweepstakes is impaired in any way for any reason, Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, either: (a) suspend the Sweepstakes to address the impairment and then resume the Sweepstakes in a manner that best conforms to the spirit of these Official Rules; or (b) award the prize at random from among the eligible entries received up to the time of the impairment. Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike, fraudulent or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. Failure by Sponsor to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. Proof of sending any communication to Sponsor by mail shall not be deemed proof of receipt of that communication by Sponsor. The Sweepstakes is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations and is void where prohibited. In the event that the Sweepstakes causes technical interference with the download, functionality, integrity, or use of the Expedia.com mobile application residing in any app store, Expedia, Inc. reserves the right to terminate this Sweepstakes prior to the aforementioned end date.</li>
        <li><strong>Release and Limitations of Liability:</strong> By participating in the Sweepstakes, you agree to release and hold harmless the Sponsor and Administrator (&ldquo;Released Parties&rdquo;), and their  subsidiaries, affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claim or cause of action arising out of participation in the Sweepstakes or receipt or use of any prize, including, but not limited to: (a) unauthorized human intervention in the Sweepstakes; (b) technical errors related to computers, servers, providers, or telephone, or network lines; (c) printing errors; (d) lost, late, postage-due, misdirected, or undeliverable mail; (e) errors in the administration of the Sweepstakes or the processing of entries; or (f) injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant's participation in the Sweepstakes or receipt or use of any prize.

You waive the right to claim any damages whatsoever, including, but not limited to, punitive, consequential, direct, or indirect damages.</li>
